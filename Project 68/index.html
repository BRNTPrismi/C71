    <h4> New School Canteen</h4>
  <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their prevvious meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

<br>
2. Economics<div>Have you ever thought attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absentism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment.

The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the uses of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
